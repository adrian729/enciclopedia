# Category Theory

## 1. What is a Category?

### 1.1. Abstraction

- **objects**: primitive for category theory (no properties or anything).
- **arrows or morphisms**: other primitive. Goes from one object to another (start - end).

**Example:**

```
f: a -> b
```

- objects `a` and `b`
- `f` arrow/morphism from `a` to `b`)

### 1.2. Category

Bunch of `objects`, and for each pair of objects 0 or more `arrows` between one and another or from one object to itself.

### 1.3. Composition

If we have:

```
f: a -> b
```

```
g: b -> c
```

then an arrow exists from `a` to `c` called `g after f`.

```
g∘f: a -> c
```

And `g∘f` is identical to the **composition** of `f` and `g`.

\* _There can be any number of other arrows `a -> c`, but if `f: a -> b` and `g: b -> c` then `g∘f` EXISTS._

### 1.4. Identity

For every object `a`, there EXISTS an arrow from it to itself, the `identity`.

<code>
id<sub>a</sub>: a -> a
</code>

 <br>

Having `f: a -> b`

---

**left identity**

<code>
id<sub>b</sub>∘f: a -> b -> b
</code>

<br>

where <code>id<sub>b</sub>∘f = f</code>

---

**right identity**

<code>
f∘id<sub>a</sub>: a -> a -> b
</code>

<br>

where <code>f∘id<sub>a</sub> = f</code>

### 1.5. Associativity

Having

```
f: a -> b
g: b -> c
h: c -> d
```

We can say that `h∘(g∘f)` and `(h∘g)∘f` are isomorphic

```
h∘(g∘f) = (h∘g)∘f = h∘g∘f
```

### Category theory in programming

An example of category in programming: `types` and `methods`.

The `types` are the objects and the `methods` the arrows or functions.

We can see `types` as `sets of values` and `methods` as `functions` between sets.

When working with category theory, we need to forget the properties of sets and functions. We are building an abstraction on top of it, all we care about is `objects` and `arrows`.
